                <p>I am a geographer(and health enthusiast) who is interested in how we talk about health, how we map health, and how we visualize health. I combine geographic information systems(GIS), data science, visualization with public health methodology in better understand the relationships with health and various phenomena across physical and virtual spaces. In addition, I also combine public health and GIS modelling in order to create innovative mobile and web apps for public
                health applications.</p>
                <p>In addition, I provide training and consultation for non-profit organizations on how to integrate spatial analysis and data science in a way to help achieve their organization's goals. I also have a background in instructional design and instructional technology and can create custom modules and educational materials to suit your or your organization's needs.</p>
